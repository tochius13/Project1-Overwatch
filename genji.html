        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Genji Shimada was born into the Shimada clan and lived a reckless life early on. After
          a fight with his brother Hanzo, he was left near death and rebuilt as a cyborg.
          Over time, he learned to accept who he is and trained to find balance.

        <h2>My Favorite Thing About His Kit</h2>
        <p>
          Blade espically when paied with Nano (Anas ult) is my favorite part.

        <ul>
          <li>Blade is super fun to use</li>
          <li>Dumb strong when you pair it up with dashes</li>
          <li>Just really pleasing when everything works out</li>
