        <h2>Why I Love Roadhog</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>He can create pressure without needing constant healing.</li>
          <li>He is super annoying to go against and super fun to be toxic with</li>
          <li>You can really solo carry</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>My Play Style</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I play corners and hold angles where hook threats matter.</li>
          <li>I look for picks before full team fights start.</li>
          <li>I save self-heal for when I know I can survive and keep space.</li>
          <li>I try to peel with hook when my backline gets pressured.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Roadhog is a masked enforcer from Australia, known for surviving chaos and turning
          into a feared outlaw. He is often connected with Junkrat, and together they have a
          reputation for crime and destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like his vibe because he feels like a character who does not care about fear. He
          just walks forward and dares you to deal with him.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>My Favorite Thing About His Kit</h2>
        <p>
          Chain Hook is my favorite part. It is simple, but it keeps the supports super scared of you at all times. One
          good hook can win a fight or force a team to play back.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hook creates picks.</li>
          <li>Hook forces respect and space.</li>
          <li>Hook punishes bad positioning.</li>
        </ul>
